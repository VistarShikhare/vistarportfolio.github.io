## Projects
### American Superstore Sales Analysis

In this comprehensive Superstore dashboard project, I dived into analyzing and visualizing key aspects of the business to provide actionable insights. The dashboard covers various dimensions, offering a holistic view of the company's performance.

The things analyzed from the insights are:

 i. Calculated and visualized total sales and profits, providing an overview of the store's financial performance.

ii. Evaluated profit ratios to understand the efficiency of operations, identifying areas for improvement.

iii. Examined sales data across different regions to identify high-performing and underperforming areas.

iv. Identified and showcased the top-most profitable items, aiding in inventory management and strategic decision-making.

v. Segregated profits by product categories (technology, office supplies, and furniture) to focus on high-profit areas.

vi. Utilized a map of the USA to illustrate total sales by each state, providing a geographic perspective on market performance.
